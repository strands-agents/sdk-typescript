/**
 * Hooks module for event-driven extensibility.
 *
 * This module has two concerns with distinct naming:
 *
 * - **Events** (`StreamEvent` and subclasses) — the data objects yielded by `agent.stream()`.
 *   Named `Stream*` because they are members of the agent stream.
 *   {@link HookableEvent} is the subset subscribable via hook callbacks.
 *   See {@link StreamEvent} and `events.ts` for the full taxonomy.
 *
 * - **Hook infrastructure** (`HookProvider`, `HookCallback`, `HookRegistry`, `HookCleanup`) —
 *   the subscription mechanism that lets providers register callbacks for {@link HookableEvent} types.
 *   Named `Hook*` because they describe the hooking/subscription pattern, not the events themselves.
